I was wondering which DMV to go to, so I came up with this little code this morning. 

### Scrape DMV website

**Objective: ** Find out which office in CA has the soonest 'first available appointment date' for getting a new ID card/Driver's License. 

**Background: ** Sometimes, it's better to drive an hour away to wait in a shorter line at the DMV.

**Set-backs: **Website uses reCAPTCHA to prove you are human when submitting the form.
