### Scrape DMV website

**Objective:** Find out which office in CA has the soonest 'first available appointment date' for getting a new ID card or Driver's License. 

**Reasoning:** I was wondering which DMV to go to, and sometimes, it's better to drive an hour away to wait in a shorter line.

**Set-backs:** Website uses reCAPTCHA to prove you are human when submitting the form.

**Still need to do:** Solve the reCAPTCHA.
