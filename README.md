I was wondering which DMV to go to, so I came up with this code this morning. 

Still need to solve the reCAPTCHA.

### Scrape DMV website

**Objective:** Find out which office in CA has the soonest 'first available appointment date' for getting a new ID card/Driver's License. 

**Reasoning:** Sometimes, it's better to drive an hour away to wait in a shorter line at the DMV.

**Set-backs:** Website uses reCAPTCHA to prove you are human when submitting the form.
